9 Dots takes an innovative, structured approach to transforming education culture in a way that takes the whole student into account – in a way that can have a sustainable impact. Impact extends well beyond the walls of 9 Dots by offering parent workshops to give families additional support. 9 Dots works with schools and educators to teach best practices for how to teach kids STEM skills and deepen students’ curiosity.
