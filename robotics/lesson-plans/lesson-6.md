In this lesson, students use their new programming techniques to upgrade their robots and have another sumo battle.

Students will be able to
  - Implement event handlers and loops
  - Iterate on robot design

#### Length: 45 minutes

1. Review - Review what students know about coding the EV3 robots.
2. Explain - Have a group discussion about how the code the event handlers and loops can make their robots better sumo bots.
3. Engage -Students program their sumo bots using the new concepts.

**Iterate** - a procedure in which repetition of a sequence of operations yields results successively closer to a desired result

Review what students know about coding the EV3 robots.

{% table %}

1) Start by asking students questions to review concepts from previous lessons.

  1. What is an event handler?
    - An event handler is code that runs after a specific event or input (such as a sensor being activated).
  2. What does a loop do?
    - A loop repeats a section of code.
  3. Which sensor is used to measure distance?
    - The ultrasonic sensor measures distances.

1) Students raise their hands to provide answers to these questions.

Have a group discussion about how the code the event handlers and loops can make their robots better sumo bots.

{% table %}

1) Explain that now when the sumo competition starts, the robots will be faced a way from each other.
2) **Guided Discussion**: How can you use these new concepts to make a better sumo bot? What are the steps of the program?

- Target: The simplest version of the sumo robot program is:
  1. Spin around in a circle forever.
  2. Wait for the ultrasonic sensor to measure an object closer than 18 inches.
  3. Move toward that object to ram it.
  4. Repeat.

Students program their sumo bots using the new concepts.

{% table %}

1) Tell students that now it is time for them to work on the code for their sumo bots. The new code should include loops and event handlers.
2) Remind students that this is an iterative process. This means that students should code, test their code, and then try to improve on it.
3) Once students have the basic code working, give the students [coding worksheet](../worksheets/lesson6-worksheet1.pdf).
,,,

1) Students work on creating new sumo programs for their robots.
3) Students use the worksheet to develop code that goes beyond the basic programming.
