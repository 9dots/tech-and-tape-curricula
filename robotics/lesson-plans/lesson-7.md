Explain to students about why iteration is important for building.

{% table %}

1) Ask students, "What is iteration?"
  - Iteration is the process of building, testing, and then improving the design in a continuous cycle.
2) Ask students, "Why is iteration important in building an designing?"
  - It is impossible to develop the perfect solution on the first attempt. Testing and iterating allows designers to see how their product works in the real world and then improve on flaws. Each cycle moves the product closer to an optimal design.
3) Explain that today, students are going to iterate and test their sumo designs. Now that their robots move around more, it may be important to design their robot differently.

Students use the [working on your build worksheet][worksheet1] to guide their thinking as they build and test their sumo designs.

{% table %}

1) Split students into their groups and distribute the [working on your build worksheet](../worksheets/lesson7-worksheet1.pdf).
2) Tell students do an initial test by participating in a sumo battle. After the test students will fill in the worksheet.
  - In these battles the robots should start facing away from each other.
3) Explain that each time students build and test they should think about the questions on the handout to plan improvements.
,,,

1) Students split into groups and gather their computers, robots and building kits.
2) Students do an initial battle, then fill in the worksheet.
3) After each cycle, students discuss the questions from the handout with their groups and plan new improvements.
